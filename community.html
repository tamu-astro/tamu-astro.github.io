										<h1>Community</h1>
									</header>
                                    <p>We work to keep a supportive and strong community within our group, which results in several offical and unofficial group activites that happen frequently.</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Organizations</h2>
                                    <p>Here, we list some of the organizations in our department that help to strengthen our community, with brief summaries about the purposes of each one. In addition to the organizations listed here, our graduates are very active in &mdash; and have also founded &mdash; a number of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)-specific organizations in our department. For information about those organizations, see our <a href="dei.html">Diversity &amp; Climate page</a>!</p>

                                            <p><strong>Astronomy on Tap B/CS</strong> is our <a href="https://astronomyontap.org/locations/bcs-tx/" target="_blank">local chapter</a> of <a href="http://astronomyontap.org/" target="blank">Astronomy on Tap (AoT)</a>, a series of free, public science presentations hosted by astronomers, typically at bars. A group of astronomy graduate students, led by <a href="https://ahriley.github.io/" target="_blank">Alex Riley</a>, founded the chapter in Spring 2018, and we have held monthly events ever since! Usually, we hold our events at the <a href="https://grandstaffordtheater.com/" target="_blank">Grand Stafford Theater</a> in Bryan. During the pandemic, we instead livestream our events on youtube at <a href="http://tx.ag/aotlive" target="_blank">tx.ag/aotlive</a>. You can watch our past events and subscribe to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUI7xJ8e8o-AgZXL-f8ciYw" target="_blank">youtube channel here</a>! You can also follow us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AoTBCS/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/AoT_BCS" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aot_bcs/?hl=en" target="_blank">Instagram</a> for up-to-date news on upcoming events!</p>

											<p>The Graduate Student Assembly is a department-wide organization run by and for the department's graduate students. They are an interface between the department administration and our graduate population. This organization was founded in 2018 by a combination of physics and astronomy graduate students (including <a href="https://tkonchady.github.io/" target="_blank">Tarini Konchady</a>).</p>

Each department has two senators who represent them in the organization, who help draft resolutions and organize events. The GPSG senators for our department are currently two astronomy graduate students, <a href="https://yaswantd.github.io/" target="_blank">Yaswant Devarakonda</a> and <a href="https://ahriley.github.io/" target="_blank">Alex Riley</a>, who this year serve in the advocacy committee (which focuses on student rights).</p>

                                        <p><strong>The Postdoc-Graduate Student Mentoring Program</strong> was founded in 2020. Each graduate student is assigned one mentor who is a current astronomy postdoc at Texas A&amp;M. Each mentor-mentee pair meets approximately once each month. The purpose of this program is to provide support and guidance to graduate students, including helping with questions about future academic life.</p>

									<h2>Astronomy Group Activites</h2>
									<ul><ul>
										<li><strong>Astronomy Coffee Discussions (aka Journal Club):</strong> we gather Friday mornings to talk about the various astronomy papers that came out that week. This serves as excellent practice for graduate students to present and discuss professional papers, as well as a learning opportunity about astronomy topics during discussions with postdocs, researchers, and faculty.</li>
										<li><strong>Tuesday Tea Time:</strong> every Tuesday, we gather for 30-45 minutes to relax and socialize with each other &mdash; taking the moment to separate ourselves from our work and get a much-needed break. Weather permitting, we often move outside to the 3rd floor garden located in our building.</li>
										<li><strong>Astrosymposium:</strong> every August, right before the semester starts, we hold an event where everyone in our astronomy group presents brief summaries of the science they've been working on for the past year. This includes our faculty, researchers, graduate students (including incoming graduates), and undergraduate students.</li>
										<li><strong>Post-Astrosymposium Happy Hour:</strong> after Astrosymposium, we gather for a large dinner/social hour. This is a really fun event where everyone is able to mingle and get to know the new students, who have just arrived for the Astrosymposium.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Liquid Physics:</strong> Every Friday afternoon, all of the physics and astronomy graduate students get together at Rough Draught to relax and socialize.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Slack:</strong> in order to help build and support community within our astronomy group, we have an active and dedicated Slack for our graduate students, postdocs, &amp; researchers. We have dozens of channel topics, including various work-related channels and non-work-related channels. A <i>lot</i> of communication happens over our Slack, and we typically use it to organize social events, such as game nights and parties.</li>
