										<h1>Diversity &amp; Climate</h1>
									</header>

									<p><strong>Academia and astronomy are hostile to under-represented people.</strong> White men are overwhelmingly overrepresented in positions of power, and almost all historically-excluded people in academia report harassment, discrimination, and targeted microaggressions. Academia is structured so that the people who commit these offenses rarely face any consequences, while those who suffer them rarely receive redress.</p>

<p>As a result, academics and astronomers have a long history of exclusion. They fail to recruit historically-excluded students, then subject those they do recruit to hostile environments, and finally neglect to promote those who remain into positions of power. Rather than implementing changes that would make academia a more equitable place, academics in positions of power&mdash;most often white men, who benefit from the racist, sexist status quo&mdash;tend to abide by their long-standing, failed institutions.</p>

<p>As certainly as we must push for change in our society at large, so we must push for change in academia. We commit to resisting and dismantling all institutions in science and academia that uphold white supremacy, racism, colonialism, and patriarchy.

									<h2>Department Organizations</h2>
									<p>The astronomy group is very active in the department, leading the way in nearly all of the measures taken to improve the climate and truly support inclusion in our community. Our graduate students especially are incredibly active, taking leadership positions across organizations and working to hold our department accountable. We recognize that there will never be a time when enough work has been done &mdash; <strong>we should always be striving to improve, challenging ourselves to push for progress as passionately as we discuss science.</strong> Our grad community is committed to pushing for concrete actions and meaningful changes, rather than perpetuating <a href="https://theriveter.co/voice/the-rules-of-the-diversity-and-inclusion-racket/">a passive environment which centers whiteness and protects the status quo</a>.</p>
									  
									<p>Below, we list some of the organizations that exist in our department, all of which have a strong astronomy presence, with brief summaries about the purposes of each one.</p>

									<!-- LIST OF ORGANIZATIONS -->
									<dl>
										<!-- SUPA -->
										<dt><h3>The Society for the Under-Represented in Physics &amp; Astronomy (<strong>SUPA</strong>)</h3></dt>
										<dd>
											<p>Established in 2016, SUPA's goal is "To bring together and provide support for diverse peoples to create and foster an inclusive and engaged community. To create a space for free communication among diverse groups to promote support and community."  SUPA works to provide a safe space for under-represented people to come together and discuss the challenges and issues they may face, both in our department and in academia in general. While SUPA is open to everyone in the department, spanning all levels (including faculty &amp; staff), they press that those more priveleged in dicsusisons to take on the full responsibility of educating themselves and not relying on under-represented peoples to do this for them.  This department-funded group was created by three astronomy graduate students (<a href="http://people.physics.tamu.edu/scantu/">Sarah Cantu</a>, <a href="https://aibhleog.github.io">Taylor Hutchison</a>, &amp; <a href="https://stringkm.github.io/">Katelyn Stringer</a>) and the leadership and membership has continued to have a very strong astronomy presence.</p>

										</dd>
										<!-- Climate & Diversity Committee -->
										<dt><h3>Climate &amp; Diversity Committee</h3></dt>
										<dd>
											<p>Established in 2018, they are tasked with developing and implementing plans to improve the climate of the department as a whole, and build and support the diversity of the scientists and students who live within it.  This group has a strong graduate student presence, and the contribution from the astronomy group has continued to be invaluable.</p>
										</dd>
										<!-- MAGIC -->
										<dt><h3>Mentoring &amp; Advising Graduates in an Inclusive Community (<strong>MAGIC</strong>)</h3></dt>
										<dd>
                                            <p>Established in June 2019, MAGIC is a mentoring program created by and for graduate students in Physics &amp; Astronomy at Texas A&amp;M. We match graduate student mentors to incoming graduate students in order to create an inclusive, supportive community to help students thrive throughout graduate school. This program was created by two astronomy graduate students (<a href="http://people.physics.tamu.edu/joncohn/">Jonathan Cohn</a> &amp; <a href="http://aibhleog.github.io">Taylor Hutchison</a>) for the astronomy program, and the MAGIC structure has since been adopted into a program for the physics side as well.</p>

										</dd>
										<dt><h3>GLASS</h3></dt>
										<dd>
											<p><strong>GLASS</strong> (not an acronym) is a collaborative astronomy graduate student-run program focused upon professional developement, where fellow graduate students create and lead workshops teaching useful skills and tricks of the trade.  All of the materials for the meetings are made available on the GLASS website and the associated GitHub organization page.</p>

									<h2>Astronomy Group Activites</h2>
									<p>We work to keep a supportive and strong community within our group, which results in several offical and unofficial group activites that happen frequently. As a note, some of these activities are no longer possible due to <strong>COVID-19</strong> restrictions, but for those that can we have moved them to zoom.</p>
									<ul><ul>
										<li><strong>Astronomy Coffee Discussions (aka Journal Club):</strong> we gather Friday mornings to talk about the various astronomy papers that came out that week. This is a great time for graduate students to not only get practice in presenting and discussing professional papers, but also provides a learning opportunity in discussion with postdocs and facutly about the various science.</li>
										<li><strong>Tuesday Tea Time:</strong> every Tuesday, we gather for 30-45 minutes to relax and socialize with each other &mdash; taking the moment to separate ourselves from our work and get a much-needed break. Weather permitting, we often move outside to the 3rd floor garden located in our building.</li>
										<li><strong>Astrosymposium:</strong> before the start of every academic year, we hold an astrosymposium where all of our astro group presents brief summaries of the science they've been working on for the past year. This includes our faculty, graduate students, and undergraduate students.</li>
										<li><strong>Post-Astrosymposium Happy Hour:</strong> occasionally, some years we have gathered after the annual astrosymposium for a large dinner/social hour.  This is a really fun event where everyone is able to mingle and get to know the new students, who have just arrived for the astrosymposium.</li>
										<li><strong>Game Nights:</strong> frequently, we have random game nights that pop up, where an assortment of grad students &amp; postdocs gather to hang out and play various games.</li>
										<li><strong>Grad+Postdoc Slack:</strong> in order to help build and support community within our astronomy group, we have an active and dedicated Slack for our graduate students &amp; postdocs.</li>
									</ul></ul>

									<h3>COVID-era Additional Activites</h3>
									<p>In addition the the events above that were able be made virtual, we have a smattering of other activities that members of our grad+postdoc community participate in, including:</p>
									<ul><ul>
										<li>Zoom Game Nights</li>
										<li>Zoom Happy Hours</li>
										<li>Socially Distant Picnics</li>
										<li>Socially Distant Happy Hours</li>
									</ul></ul>
