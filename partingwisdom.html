										<h1>Parting Wisdom from Past Grads</h1>
									</header>

									<!--<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>-->

									<p>Starting in 2018, a new tradition formed.  As our brilliant, wonderful graduate students finished their degrees and left to go do bigger and brighter things, some of them left parting advice to their former graduate student colleagues. This has continued since, building into the tradition that is it today. Recently, the graduate students have begun compiling this advice and will share the wisdom shared throughout the years here, for anyone who may need it.</p>
									
									<p>We'll continue adding to this as our graduates share their parting wisdom.</p>

                                    <h2>Peter Ferguson, PhD &mdash; September 2021</h2>
                                    <p>I think the advice I would like to pass on to others the most is:</p>
                                    <ul><ul>
                                        <li>Make sure grad school is sustainable for you. There is no future in suffering/grinding hard enough that you survive, but are completely burned out and feel no joy in your work/day to day. Also, for me finding a support network made all of the difference. Some, of this came from the department, but also look to outside groups and make friends!</li>
                                        <li>Part of the above is that you should take agency in your work. If you do not like your project go find another one. If you are not getting along with your advisor, go find a new one. This is your degree you should make sure it becomes what you want it to be. (all this is easier said then done :dancing_charmander:)</li>
                                        <li>For me one of the most important steps in making research/grad school sustainable was to clearly and regularly communicate with my advisors. Making sure that what I thought their expectations of me were agreed with what they thought their expectations of me were.</li>
                                        <li>You all deserve to be here, and will be successful. It is just a matter of figuring out what success means in grad school/life/evolution of the universe and what you enjoy doing XD.</li>
                                    </ul></ul>
                                    <p>As others have said, feel free to reach out whenever, I am happy to help (even if we do not know each other).</p>

                                    <hr class="major" />
                                    
                                    <h2>Vince Estrada-Carpenter, PhD &mdash; August 2021</h2>
                                    <p>It’s time for me to leave the channel. If you all ever want advice about anything, including job search stuff, feel free to reach out. As for some departing words of wisdom I'd say don't be afraid to cut your day short when things aren't working out. I certainly had days where I kept making mistakes and had no motivation. I found it was best to just take the rest of the day off and recharge, usually that's all I needed. Remember that grad school is a long journey and there’s nothing wrong with taking some time for yourself.</p>

                                    <hr class="major" />

									<h2>Leo Alcorn, PhD &mdash; May 2019</h2>
									<p>Unfortunately it is time for me to leave the grad-only spaces here. I have just been hooded. Katelyn is the new queen, hopefully not very long may she reign. Some thoughts I want you to know.
										<ul><ul>
											<li>This is hard. Our greatest strength is each other. Keep being good to each other. Keep our traditions and make new ones. Talk to each other, participate, and stand up for each other. Do not let our space be poisoned with mean-spirited competitiveness, backstabbing, or gossip.</li>
											<li>You are doing fine. You will be okay. Take it one day at a time. Do a little bit every day. A little bit adds up when you do it every day. As Ben said, It’s a marathon, not a race.</li>
											<li>Better to do a little half-assed work than to do no work. Again, it will add up. Half-assed, tired, hurried work riddled with errors is how I finished all my papers.</li>
											<li>Seize your opportunities. They will not come to you. When you have the option, participate, network, talk to people. Get lunch with people when you visit places. Apply for far-fetched opportunities. Go out for the conference dinner and drinks. Get lunch with the speaker and meet with them individually.</li>
											<li>Academia does not have to be depressing, or hard, or soul-crushing, or anything like that. You do not have to be miserable, you do not have to suffer. Enjoy your life now. And make things easier and more enjoyable for other people. You deserve joy. Yes, things will suck sometimes, but they don’t have to constantly suck and you do not have to work yourself into misery.</li>
											<li>If you are inclined, make this into your hero’s journey. Mythologize your PhD and M.S. You are in a great becoming, a great transformation. You are becoming an observer of the cosmos, you are the eyes of the universe. When you have trials, they are you looking into the darkness and void, and you will stare back into it bravely, and cross it. If you are as inclined as me, create rituals to mark your transitions: completed classes, first paper, your M.S. defense, your prelim, your PhD defense.</li>
										</ul></ul>
										Anyway... please let me know if you need me to help you in any way. I will be here.</p>

										<li>Pace yourself</li>
										<li>Take care of your body</li>
										<li>Don't hate what you do</li>
										<li>Don't give up!</li>
									</ul></ul></p>
									Additionally, if astronomy isn't what you want to do post-Master's or post-PhD, there is nothing wrong with leaving.  Doing so is not a failure nor is it "giving up", you are doing what is best for you.
